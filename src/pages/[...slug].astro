					<h2 class="heading">What I am and what I'm not (yet)</h2>
					<p>Front-end is a broad term in 2024. Many come via a computer science route, and others from a more creative background. My flavour of front-end is more-so the latter, but I continue to edge closer towards an ideal mix of the two.</p>

					<p>I specialise in UI patterns, user experiences, interactions, accessibility, page speed, and the visual and structural aspects of web pages and apps.</p>
						
					<p>I also have vast experience in marketing environments, which has facilitated a well-rounded skill set in lead-gen, e-commerce, CRO, SEO, A/B testing and more.</p>
						
					<p>CSS is my first love, but JavaScript has been gaining ground in recent years, and I've enjoyed the transition to working in modern JS frameworks, with considerable experience in Next.js, Gatsby, Astro and Eleventy.</p>
						
					<p>I'd like to think I'm the sort of person you can bet on. I'm extremely adaptable and a very fast learner, generally able to achieve a high level in most of what I turn my focus to. So if you think there are any gaps in my skill set, I'm confident these can be quickly filled.</p>

					<p>The sequel to my original side-project which I sold for a five-figure sum, messivsronaldo.app began as a learning exercise and developed into a real passion project. <button class="read-more-btn">Read more</button></p>

					<div class="[&>*]:mt-4 hidden read-more-content">
						<p>Built with Gatsby, this site was my gateway into React, and I can't understate how much I learnt during both the initial build and the never-ending feature additions. It combined my love of sports, statistics, and development to form a very energising side-hustle that was immeasurably beneficial to my personal development.</p>
							
						<p>The original iteration of this side-project which I previously alluded to (messivsronaldo.net), I created in 2012 and sold in 2016 with an average daily user count of around 15,000, and a firm grip of the top spots in Google for the most relevant search terms.</p>
							
						<p>In a little over a year, this new version had toppled its predecessor, and went on to achieve some dizzying numbers, pulling in 12 million users in a single year despite zero financial investment on marketing.</p>

				<div class="[&>*]:mt-4 hidden read-more-content">
          <p>The site is an at-a-glance, quick-reference resource showing the top scorers and assisters in football's biggest competitions.</p>

					<p>It was an immensely enjoyable build, with the Astro developer experience probably my overall favourite at the moment.</p>
						
					<p>Without going into too much detail about the data side, the site makes creative use of the Google Sheets API, auto-updates and costs nothing to run.</p>

					<h2 class="heading">I love writing about the web, too</h2>
					<p>When I started out in the industry, I was a very earnest blogger, regularly posting tips, tutorials and experimental demos using all the fancy new features that came under the umbrella of "CSS3".</p>
					
					<p>It was this activity that caught the attention of global publishers Wiley, who approached me with an offer to write an extensive book on advanced CSS3. And after several months of very hard work and very late nights, CSS3 Pushing the Limits - totalling 384 pages - was published in late 2013.</p>
						
					<p>The book received favourable reviews, and despite its age would still hold some weight today due to the cutting edge nature of the material, with the likes of Grid, Flexbox, Keyframe Animation and Custom Properties covered in detail.</p>
						
					<p>I've also been published by Smashing Magazine, writing a chapter on the intricacies of CSS Timing Functions for their book on animation.</p>

					<p>My blogging became much less frequent in subsequent years as other work and family life took precedence, but this is something I'm looking to get back into in a big way since launching my new <a target="_blank" href="https://ste.digital/">personal site</a> earlier this year, as I'm a big believer that the best way to master something is to write about it.</p>

			<p>My primary focus has been front-end development, with a real speciality in UI engineering, implementing designs with meticulous care and precision.</p>

			<p>I've worn many other hats in this role too, making me extremely comfortable managing my own projects from start to finish, and communicating with clients and other stakeholders.</p>
				
			<p>The role has also contributed to my extensive all-round web knowledge, thanks to working closely with experienced marketers to ensure the ongoing success of our products. I subsequently have a wealth of knowledge in areas such as SEO, CRO, A/B testing, and page speed, affording me the kind of marketing know-how that only really comes with experience.</p>
				
			<p>Further still, I've been heavily involved in training and upskilling the 20+ strong web team throughout my time at Adtrak, which I expand on more later in this application.</p>

I was in charge of overseeing a small team of designers and developers, who I helped transition from WYSIWYG style builds to custom built WordPress sites.</p>

      <p>Although a short tenure, I'm extremely proud of the impact I made on the fortunes of a small business in such a short space of time.</p>
