					<p>Front-end is a broad term in 2024. Many come via a computer science route, and others from a more creative background. My flavour of front-end is more-so the latter, but I continue to edge closer towards an ideal mix of the two.</p>

					<p>I specialise in UI patterns, user experiences, interactions, accessibility, page speed, and the visual and structural aspects of web pages and apps.</p>
						
					<p>I also have vast experience in marketing, which has facilitated a well-rounded skill set; lead-gen, e-commerce, CRO, SEO, A/B testing...</p>
						
					<p>I wouldn't quite describe myself as full-stack, but I love JavaScript and I've loved the transition to working in modern JS frameworks over the last 6-7 years, with considerable experience in Next.js, Gatsby, Astro and Eleventy.</p>
						
					<p>I'd like to think I'm the sort of person you can bet on. I'm extremely adaptable and a very fast learner, generally able to achieve a high level in whatever I turn my focus to. So if you think there are any gaps in my skill set, I'm confident these can be filled in a very short space of time.</p>

					<p>The sequel to my original side-project which I sold for a five-figure sum, messivsronaldo.app began as a learning exercise and developed into a real passion project. <button class="read-more-btn">Read more</button></p>

					<div class="[&>*]:mt-4 hidden read-more-content">
						<p>Built with Gatsby, this site was my gateway into React, and I can't understate how much I learnt during both the initial build and the never-ending feature additions. It was a constant work in progress for the best part of 2 years, and it was fantastic to have a project that really energised me in the way that this did.</p>
							
						<p>The original iteration of this side-project which I previously alluded to (messivsronaldo.net), I created in 2012 and sold in 2016 with an average daily user count of around 15,000, and a firm grip of the top spots in Google for the most relevant search terms.</p>
							
						<p>This new version was initially a learning exercise primarily, but soon began to show some promise in terms of organic performance. In a little over a year it had toppled its predecessor, and went on to achieve some dizzying numbers, despite zero financial investment on marketing.</p>
							
						<p>In the year from October 2022 to September 2023, the site had 11.7 million users, an average of 32,000 per day. It has also surpassed 100k users in a single day on 8 occasions, including twice breaking the 200k barrier! The all time high was 226,323 on Monday 19th December 2022, the day after Lionel Messi's World Cup triumph.</p>

				<p>Top Scorers Club is another recently launched side project with a simple purpose; an at-a-glance, quick-reference resource showing the top scorers and assisters in football's biggest competitions. <button class="read-more-btn">Read more</button></p>

				<div class="[&>*]:mt-4 hidden read-more-content">
					<p>The site was built with Astro, and I have to say it was an immensely enjoyable build, with the Astro developer experience probably my overall favourite at the moment.</p>
						
					<p>Without going into too much detail about the data side, the site makes creative use of the Google Sheets API, auto-updates and costs nothing to run.</p>
