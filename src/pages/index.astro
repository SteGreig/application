					<p>Front-end is a broad term in 2024. Many come via a computer science route, and others from a more creative background. My flavour of front-end is more-so the latter, but I continue to edge closer towards an ideal mix of the two.</p>

					<p>I specialise in UI patterns, user experiences, interactions, accessibility, page speed, and the visual and structural aspects of web pages and apps.</p>
						
					<p>I also have vast experience in marketing, which has facilitated a well-rounded skill set; lead-gen, e-commerce, CRO, SEO, A/B testing...</p>
						
					<p>I wouldn't quite describe myself as full-stack, but I love JavaScript and I've loved the transition to working in modern JS frameworks over the last 6-7 years, with considerable experience in Next.js, Gatsby, Astro and Eleventy.</p>
						
					<p>I'd like to think I'm the sort of person you can bet on. I'm extremely adaptable and a very fast learner, generally able to achieve a high level in whatever I turn my focus to. So if you think there are any gaps in my skill set, I'm confident these can be filled in a very short space of time.</p>
